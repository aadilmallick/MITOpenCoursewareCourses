Students in this course will help build an architectural index useful to help navigate the unprecedented \"Silver Tsunami\" that the United States and other industrialized countries have never before encountered, students will develop a variety of new designs on that can aid in alleviating the double housing and care crises that financially cripples 90% of older adults.

    "description": "\n              Laboratory-style class explores and invents techniques used to create dances. Students practice techniques focused on how and where to begin making a dance — sampling some of the endless ways to start a process, such as from the body, an idea, text, or a song — and then how to build up from there. Students make dances that are more than just a collection of moves, but events that do something, say something, or ask something. Builds a clear understanding of how a dance has an arc, a clear beginning, middle, and end, so that by doing it or watching it, both participants and audience end up somewhere new. Develops an understating of, and facility with, a wide variety of topics used to explore, start, and generate movement, dance, and performative events involving bodies moving through space.

By bringing a living cultural expression into the classroom through an Indigenous speaker series of historians, artists, spiritual, medicine leaders, language speakers, scientists, land / water conservationists, culture and song keepers, clan leaders and elders, crafts makers/keepers, food/seed keepers, and storytellers, students will be engaged into the living expression of oral tradition and NE Indigenous culture today.\n\nWe'll study an inside view taught by Wampanoag scholar, Leslie Jonas, who brings to light the critical role of the Eastern Woodlands coastal perspective in preserving and protecting our natural kinships to land, water, and all of creation. Through our exploration, this class creates a space for critical thinking and a dismantling of earlier academic learning that likely included biases, misinterpretations, and false narratives. Students will be expected to self-reflect on images, imprints, pre-conceived notions taught to them over their developmental years in school and the false histories some, if not many learned from colonized views of our history, lived experiences, culture, language, relationships and world views to the natural world.

The workshop aims to provide Ph.D. students working on climate change, across sectors and disciplines, with a foundation in the theoretical and methodological approaches of polit-ical economy to conceptualize and conduct independent research. Substantively, the work-shop takes a critical political economy approach to the climate crisis and examines three in-terrelated dimensions: (1) the political governance challenge of mobilizing climate action, given the need to design new institutional mechanisms to address the global and intergener-ational distributional aspects of climate change; (2) the economic challenge of devising new institutional approaches to equitably finance climate action in ways that go beyond the cur-rently dominant economic rationale; and (3) the cultural challenge – and opportunity – of empowering an adaptive socio-cultural ecology through traditional knowledge and local-level social networks to achieve climate resilience.\n            "

    "description": "\n              Barring natural catastrophes, the single most important factor enhancing human flourishing has been a society’s ability to conduct war with other means: diplomacy. This closely connects the arts of war to the arts of peace. Over the past two centuries Western European and American hegemony have globally enforced the “Westphalian system” of diplomacy, which relies on principles of the equal sovereignty of states, contractual obligations, and coalition-building. Yet, this system is currently failing in the face of strongman politics, world order polarization, mass migration, deep-rooted ethnic conflict, climate injustice, and gross inequality. How can we remake our diplomatic order in the service of collective human flourishing? And what diplomatic models across world history have encouraged the art of peace-making?\n\nWe explore this question through six modules. First, we take stock of our historical moment, examining the roots of today’s Westphalian world order and of the current failure of diplomacy. Next, we build our conceptual toolbox by reading strategy classics for War & Peace, including Sunzi’s Art of War, Kautilya’s Treatise on Statecraft, Machiavelli’s The Prince, Napoleon’s Military Maxims, Joseph Nye on soft power and more. We then explore different diplomatic systems across world history through historical and literary texts, including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean diplomatic poetry, Ferdowsi’s Shahnahme. The Book of Kings, Luo Guanzhong’s Romance of the Three Kingdoms. This prepares us to become creative, critical and constructive in our last three modules. We will play games of diplomacy with experts from the MIT Game Lab and work through the K-Drama Queen Seondeok to create a theory of K-drama diplomatics. These two modules help us assess how our media culture primes us for success—or failure—of peace-making and human flourishing and will inspire us to reflect on how to design diplomacy games and TV series that prime us for better diplomacy. The class reaches its highpoint with a “New Diplomacy Summit,” where students present their final projects—strategies and tools for building a better world through better diplomacy. We can test our ideas against  the real world in a final zoom meeting with diplomats and policy-makers associated with the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator.\n            "

    "description": "\n              While machine learning techniques have had significant success in single-agent settings, an increasingly large body of literature has been studying settings involving several learning agents with different objectives. In these settings, standard training methods, such as gradient descent, are less successful and the simultaneous learning of the agents commonly leads to nonstationary and even chaotic system dynamics. \n\nMotivated by these challenges, this course presents the foundations of multi-agent systems from a combined game-theoretic, optimization and learning-theoretic perspective, building from matrix games (such as rock-paper-scissors) to stochastic games, imperfect information games, and games with non-concave utilities. We will present manifestations of these models in machine learning applications, from solving Go to multi-agent reinforcement learning, adversarial learning and broader multi-agent deep learning applications. We will discuss aspects of equilibrium computation and learning as well as the computational complexity of equilibria. We will also discuss how the different models and methods have allowed several recent breakthroughs in AI, including human- and superhuman-level agents for established games such as Go, Poker, Diplomacy, and Stratego.

Urban areas are significant contributors to carbon emissions due to factors like transportation, industry, and energy consumption. Therefore, addressing carbon emissions in cities is crucial for global efforts to combat climate change. In an urban social carbon economy, the course will focus on efforts to reduce carbon emissions and will explore methodologies to design solutions with a focus on social equity, community well-being, and inclusive development within urban contexts. \n\nThe course examines the intersections that enable individuals, communities, institutions, and corporations to take action by actively measuring, monitoring, and reducing their carbon emissions. By deepening in the understanding of the power of Artificial Intelligence and behavior change, which has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by one-third globally, the new carbon economy will create opportunities to accelerate the net-zero goals across all industries. Students will deepen their understanding of carbon avoidance and reduction products and infrastructure that leverage existing and new technologies like AI, sensor fusion, gamification, blockchain, and incentive systems that will power the new economy.\n            "
